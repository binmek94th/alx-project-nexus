# ALX Project Nexus

Welcome to **alx-project-nexus**, a documentation hub that summarizes my key learnings and experiences throughout the **ALX ProDev Backend Engineering Program**.

This repository reflects my progress, understanding, and personal takeaways from working with modern backend technologies and practices.

---

## 🚀 Program Overview

The **ProDev Backend Engineering** program is an intensive, hands-on training initiative focused on preparing learners to become proficient backend developers. It covered core programming skills, modern frameworks, development tools, and engineering best practices.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- **Python**  
  Solidified understanding of OOP, data structures, and scripting  
  Built CLI tools and backend services using Python

- **Django**  
  Developed full-featured web applications with Django  
  Implemented authentication, permissions, and ORM queries

- **REST APIs**  
  Designed RESTful APIs using Django REST Framework (DRF)  
  Learned best practices for versioning, filtering, and pagination

- **GraphQL**  
  Explored schema-based API design using Graphene for Django  
  Implemented queries, mutations, and nested data fetching

- **Docker**  
  Containerized applications using Docker and Docker Compose  
  Managed isolated environments for development and deployment

- **CI/CD**  
  Configured GitHub Actions and Jenkins for continuous integration  
  Automated testing and deployment pipelines
  
- Kubernetes fundamentals for container orchestration and automated scaling  
- Web monitoring tools and techniques to ensure uptime and performance  
- Implementing firewalls for securing backend services and APIs  
- Load balancing strategies to distribute traffic efficiently across servers  
- Using HAProxy for reverse proxying and intelligent routing of requests  
- Designing highly available (HA) backend systems to minimize downtime  
- Git workflows including Git Flow, feature branching, pull requests, and effective collaboration  

### Important Backend Development Concepts

- **Database Design**  
  ER modeling, normalization, and schema-per-tenant strategies  
  Efficient indexing and query optimization with PostgreSQL

- **Asynchronous Programming**  
  Async views in Django with async def  
  Background jobs using Celery and Redis

- **Caching Strategies**  
  Used django-redis for low-latency data access  
  Applied caching at view, object, and template levels

## 👇 Challenges Faced & Solutions

- **Challenge:** Containerizing legacy Django apps\\
  **Solution:** Wrote Dockerfiles from scratch and isolated dependencies with Docker Compose
- **Challenge:** Passing the ALX automatic assignment checker, which required precise validation and logic matching  
  **Solution:** Invested time in deeply understanding how the ALX checker validates fields and enforces rules, then designed the API payload validation and business logic to mimic that process and satisfy the   checker’s requirements
- **Challenge:** Deploying and managing backend services in a scalable and reliable way  
  **Solution:** Learned Kubernetes fundamentals to containerize, orchestrate, and manage application deployments, enabling automated scaling, self-healing, and easier infrastructure management

### 🚧 What I Will Be Building

I will build a social media application that leverages both GraphQL and REST Framework. This project will include features such as:

- User authentication and profiles  
- Posting, commenting, and liking functionality  
- Efficient data fetching with GraphQL queries and mutations  
- Secure and scalable REST APIs for core backend services  

## 🗞️ Best Practices & Personal Takeaways

- Write modular, reusable code with clear separation of concerns
- Always write tests — they save time and catch bugs early
- Use environment variables to keep secrets out of code
- Logging and monitoring are essential for production-ready systems
- Think in systems: APIs, databases, queues, and workers must all work harmoniously
